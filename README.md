# Frontend Interview Questions & Challenges

This repository is a collection of my solutions to common frontend interview questions and coding challenges. Each project is self-contained in its own directory.

## Projects

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository:

-   **[Progress Bar](./progress-bar/)**: A simple, animated progress bar component built with React and TypeScript. This project demonstrates state management, props, and CSS animations using the `transform` property.

<!-- Add new projects here as you complete them! -->

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shubhamrawat090/Frontend-Interview-Questions.git
    cd Frontend-Interview-Questions
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```
    For example:
    ```bash
    cd progress-bar
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Most projects use `npm` for package management.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the local development server, and you can view the project in your browser.
